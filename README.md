# ROSS Shell

The main goal of this project is to create the most effcient GUI possible. You can find the various components in the following folders:
- ApplicationLauncher: desktop independent application launcher using a radial menu
- wm-configs: session and configurations files

## Installation and Usage
Follow the instructions in the wiki.

## Features
- Plantext configuration: Editing configuration files *outside* of an interface makes it more portable and easier to work with.
- (upcoming) Conditional status: For example, if you're playing *DOOM*, or working with *GIMP*, you should be able to unbind certain shortcuts. If you binded *CTRL-Click* to do something, but in those programs, you don't want that, then it should be possible to disable the shortcuts. Some other conditions that are not decided yet can also be added.
- (upcoming) Profiles: This is an extension of the previous point, but with different profiles.

For the programming language and framework we use Qt with C++ and some small libraries like libqtxdg.
